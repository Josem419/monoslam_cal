Implementation of using a SLAM formulation to calibrate monocular cameras in real-time

## Motivation

This code was implmented as part of a university project. My goal was to get familiarity with visual SLAM systems by implementing a basic one. 

The goal is to use a SLAM system and techniques to calibrate cameras. While most SLAM systems assume a good camera extrinsic calibration as a prior, my goal was to leverage SLAM for online calibration on a mobile robot. 

The choice to use python was one of convenience given the available libraries. For a more performant real-time/online SLAM system for calibration I would reimplemnt this in C++.
